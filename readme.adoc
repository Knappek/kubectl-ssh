= kubectl SSH Plugin

This plugin will provide you with an easy to use command for ssh'ing into a
Kubernetes node. To use this command you need to run `kubectl` version 1.10+
once you have that installed you just need to add this package to the install
path.

== Installation

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.kube/plugins
git clone https://github.com/christopherhein/kubectl-ssh.git ~/.kube/plugins/ssh
----

== Usage

As long as you have your ssh key in your `ssh-agent` you will be able to use
this command to `ssh` directly into the node you'd like to access.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl plugin ssh <node-name>
----

If you need to pass an ssh key you can pass the `-i` flag that will append the
proper identity file.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl plugin ssh <node-name> -i ~/.ssh/foo.pem
----

If you'd like to see the full usage you can pass `--help` to print out the
following.

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl plugin ssh --help
Opens up an SSH connection to the node that you pass into the command, allowing you to work faster
without writing out the full ssh command.

Examples:
  kubectl plugin ssh <node-name>

Options:
  -i, --identity-file='~/.ssh/id_rsa': Identity file to use for the ssh command.
  -u, --ssh-user='admin': User to use for the ssh command.

Usage:
  kubectl plugin ssh [flags] [options]
----

== Roadmap

* Add support for passing `master` or `worker` to randomly select an instance.
